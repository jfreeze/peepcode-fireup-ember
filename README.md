Fire Up Ember - My version of the code


## Code for Peepcode Video 'Fire Up Ember.js'

This is my version of the project developed in the Peepcode video "Fire Up Ember.js".

It has the following features:

* It is works with Ember RC6.
* Uses Sinatra
* Uses Twitter Bootstrap. (nothing fancy here)

Currently, it uses fixtures for data. If I get any requests, I will update it to read data from the server.

If you have not purchased the Peepcode video, please respect the copyright rules and keep yourself legal. BTW, it's a great video if you haven't seen it.

I have no affiliations wtih Peepcode.
